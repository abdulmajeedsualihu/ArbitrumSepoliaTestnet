# ArbitrumSepoliaTestnet
First of all i created a repository on github called ArbitrumSepoliaTestnet and then clone it on my remix app on existing workspace.
I then included my License which is '// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT' in the SimpleStorage.sol file, after that i made sure i included my solidity version which is pragma solidity ^0.8.25; I then start to write my codes after finishing it, i compiled it and tested it and made sure its working the way i want it.
i then head over to complete StorageFactory.sol file. I then Override Functions and Use Virtual/Override Keywords in the contracts.
I then head over to connect my metamask wallet, after a successful connection i started to deploy and test to make sure its working correctly.
